Multi-struct mode:
    Load(file) needs to count the various hash types in the list and if there's more than *two*, load in multi-struct mode.
        This has a potential issue where the first type *isn't* a list and we'd need to show them both. I'm not sure this would happen though.

    Alternative:
        Check the field types of the last entry.
            If it's just a list of the previous one type, load as single-struct.
            If it has multiple field types, load in multi-struct.

            This would be more 'correct', but be much more complicated.
