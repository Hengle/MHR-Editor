Monster Hunter Rise data file editor.

Everything's in the [wiki](https://github.com/Synthlight/MHR-Editor/wiki).


Building

Game text is pre-extracted and committed to the repo since it's small enough.<br>
Structs/enums however *must* be generated before the editor will compile. See [here](Generator/README.md) for more.
